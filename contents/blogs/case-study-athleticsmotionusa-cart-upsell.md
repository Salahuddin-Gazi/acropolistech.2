## Challenges

Every A/B test or Hypothesis comes with challenges and difficulties. There are also some challenges, like:

1. Collecting all ["MAGIC WAIST-SHAPER LEGGINGS"](https://athleticsmotionusa.com/collections/summer-sale-ends-today/products/waist-pro) product informations. These are also devised not only in colors but also styles, sizes.
   - **Styles:** Separating products according to styles, two styles for this product category "NO POCKET" & "WITH POCKET"
   - **Colors:** Separating Styles according to colors, four colors for each style "BLACK", "GRAY", "PURPLE" & "GREEN"
   - **Sizes:** Finally separating the colors according to sizes, each color has seven sizes "S", "M", "L", "XL", "2XL", "3XL", "XS"
2. Collecting the reviews/stars
3. Also collecting the data of the availability of the product

So if you look into the products findings and collecting according to styles, colors and sizes it comes around 60 products, all these products have reviews/stars and also availability to check.

## How Acropolis Tech created the experiment/test

With our excellent resources, first we started looking into the requirements, it's devised into three parts **Cart Upsell**, **Promo Text/Typo** & **Ratings For Product Lists**.

1. **Cart Upsell**, already mentioned the actual challenges we face for the whole test. For cart upsell we collected products info and started making a very dynamic user friendly cart upsell UI. Which is very easy for user to interact and order products directly without going to the specific product description page. This is something gave Athletics Motion a revenue boost.
2. **Promo Text/Typo**, this is also needed to be dynamically changed when user add something to the cart from product description page or cart upsell. When user adds something in the cart, the message start appearing on the top of the cart upsell that "You are $X away from getting 10% offer", for more or $90 expenditure or "You are $X away from getting 15% offer", for more or $140 expenditure.
3. **Ratings For Product Lists**, in the original mini cart this was not included, so this will come along with the variation. Whatever the products user add to mini cart he/she needs to see the actual ratings of the product.

We have successfully solved all the challenges and created the test according to the requirements.

## Challenges

Every A/B test or hypothesis encounters its fair share of challenges and complexities. In the case of our experiment, we faced the following hurdles:

1. Gathering comprehensive product information for the enticing ["MAGIC WAIST-SHAPER LEGGINGS"](https://athleticsmotionusa.com/collections/summer-sale-ends-today/products/waist-pro) category. This involved categorizing products not only by color but also by style and size.
   - **Styles:** Segmenting products based on two distinct styles within this product category: "NO POCKET" and "WITH POCKET."
   - **Colors:** Further segregating styles by four captivating colors: "BLACK," "GRAY," "PURPLE," and "GREEN."
   - **Sizes:** Finally, organizing colors according to seven different sizes: "S," "M," "L," "XL," "2XL," "3XL," and "XS."
2. Collecting and incorporating product reviews and star ratings into the experiment.
3. Ensuring the availability of each product while gathering the necessary data.

Thus, considering the intricate nature of the products, their styles, colors, sizes, and associated reviews, our efforts encompassed approximately 60 distinct products that required meticulous attention and verification.

## How Acropolis Tech Developed the Experiment/Test

Leveraging our exceptional resources, Acropolis Tech embarked on a comprehensive strategy to address the requirements, which were divided into three core elements: **Cart Upsell,** **Promotional Text,** & **Product List Ratings**.

1. **Cart Upsell:** Given the challenges associated with our experiment, we undertook the task of gathering product information and creating a dynamic and user-friendly cart upsell user interface. This intuitive interface enables users to effortlessly interact with the system and directly order products without navigating to the individual product description pages. This strategic enhancement significantly boosted Athletics Motion's revenue.

2. **Promotional Text:** We recognized the need for dynamic changes in the promotional text whenever a user adds items to their cart, whether from the product description page or the cart upsell. As users add items to their cart, the message dynamically appears at the top of the cart upsell, showcasing enticing offers such as "You are $X away from receiving a 10% discount" for orders totaling $90 or more, and "You are $X away from receiving a 15% discount" for orders totaling $140 or more.

3. **Product List Ratings:** As an additional enhancement to the original mini cart, we introduced the inclusion of product ratings for all items users add to their mini cart. This valuable addition enables users to make more informed decisions based on actual product ratings.

By successfully overcoming these challenges, we effectively developed and implemented the test, aligning with Athletics Motion's specific requirements.
